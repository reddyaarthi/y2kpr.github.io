# This is the data for my blog

It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

This repo is built on top of a fork of http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll. Thanks mojombo for open sourcing it!

# How to run the website locally

1. Install the bundler using: `gem install bundler`. If gem command does not exist, install ruby first.

2. At the root of this repository, run `bundle install` to install the necessary dependencies from the Gemfile.

3. Run the website locally using: `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

4. Preview the website at http://localhost:4000.
