### Who am I?
I am a student at the University of Texas. I study computer science. One of my major goals in life is to save 50 times my annual expenditure. As a result, I invest in companies over a long-term as a hobby. I love new technology, long walks, yoga and some partying.

### Why am I writing this blog?
I notice that there are more sources of consumption in my life than outlets for creative expression. I am writing this blog to address the imbalance. Right now, there is no higher purpose than this for this blog. This is meant to be for self-reflection and pleasure. However, I am happy if you find anything helpful in my musings.

### What am I writing about?
[Tim Ferriss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Ferriss) said that he invests to improve his **quality of life**. In other words, any investment (time or money) that does not improve your quality of life is not an investment. I resonate with this idea. In this blog, I will explore what I am investing in and how it affects the quality of life in my own experience.

I will have a new post every week on Sunday.
