### What's my experience of the class?
Alright, this is my last blog post for this class. However, I want to keep this going and write about my experience during the internship! For this post, I would like to just write about my experience in this class, the highs and the lows. First off, I never learned a single language with such depth before this class. Though the details may not stick with me after a semester, I enjoyed the experience. It definitely instilled an appreciation for the little quirks in each language. One thing I learned in this class that will definitely stick with me are the design principles (SOLID principles). However, in class we do not go over the design principles in depth. The readings do. I would have enjoyed the class more if we spent more time on how to write well-designed object oriented code. If you are looking to learn C++ (a very useful language to learn), look no further. Take this class! If you are looking to learn good object oriented design (OOD), I would still recommend this class for the readings we go into. However, the class is not completely oriented towards teaching OOD. Finally, thanks to Prof. Downing! This is the best CS class I have taken so far. I look forward to taking another one of his classes.
