### What did you do this past week?
Last week, I did not do much regarding this class except for attending classes and doing the required readings. I finished my Algorithms homework. I also worked a lot on [Desk](http://www.desk.education). I fixed memory leaks in our product. I also helped implement the autosave feature and redesign the product. Overall, I spent a lot of time on our startup last week.

### What will you do next week?
Next week is study time. I have three exams next week. Two of them are on Thursday and one on Friday. I will focus on OOP and Algorithms tests until Thursday. After Friday, I am DONE with my semester. I will just relax for the weekend. I start my internship on Monday.

### What's in your way?
I am trying to figure out the best way to study for the OOP test. There is a lot of material covered since test 1. I need to form a game plan for my test preparation.

### What's my experience of the class?
Last week's classes have been fun. I learned a bunch of new things about C++. I feel like gaining an in-depth knowledge in one language like C++ can also get me better at coding in other languages as well. The best class of the week goes to...Wednesday's class! This class was on explaining how the Proxy pattern worked. I enjoyed the detail we went into describing this pattern. With [Desk](http://www.desk.education), we actually do something quite similar to handle our math expressions. We could make it better from what I learned in this class.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
 I always thought memory leaks were not possible in a garbage collected language. That is wrong! My tip-of-the-week is this: languages that use [Automatic Reference Counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Reference_Counting) (ARC) can cause memory leaks. If you are ever working with such languages (like Swift), make sure you set unused objects to null. Also, [xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) provides some amazing tools to debug memory leaks. I was amazed by the things an IDE like xcode can do for you.
